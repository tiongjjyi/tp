### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [**`StageManager`**](#stageManager-component): Keeps track of the App's current stage.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

StageManager (shown in the diagram above) is accessible by the Logic component for checking and updating the app's current stage.

Each of the other four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface.

Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component),
as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Interactions Inside the Ui Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CourseListPanel`, `CombinedPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiComponent` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `MainWindow` includes a `DisplayPanel`, which has three different states it can toggle between
1. The `SplashPanel` for the opening splash window
2. The `CombinedPanel` that displays the student list and a course list sidebar
3. The `CoursePanel` that displays the course list (this is otherwise known as the `home` screen)

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI components are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute the commands.
* keeps a reference to the `StageManager` to update the `UI` with its corresponding display panel.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Course` and `Student` objects residing in the `Model`.
* depends on some classes in the `Storage` component, as it updates to and retrieves user inputs from the `Storage`.

The typical flow of a user's interaction with the UI is as follows.

![Standard action flow of Ui Component](images/UiActivityDiagram.png)

During startup, the MainWindow will be displayed and all components loaded into it, with a splash screen showing before
entering the course list display.

For user commands, there are two unique commands which cause separate actions to be performed:
* `exit`, which immediately closes the application.
* `help`, which displays the help window pop-up.

After each command (assuming the application is not closed), the UI will check with the StageManager to see which stage it is set to,
(either StageManager.HOME or StageManager.SELECTED_COURSE) and displays the corresponding panel
(CourseListPanel for `HOME` and CombinedPanel for `SELECTED_COURSE`).

This action flow will loop until the user decides to exit the application.
During the application's runtime, the user may  also exit the application through the MainWindow's top panel buttons (File -> Exit)
or the red '**x**' button on the top right of the application screen.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram bellow ilustrates the interactions within the `Logic` componenet, using `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CodeSphereParser` object to parse the user command. This in turns creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCourseCommandParser`) which will parse the relevant arguments in the user input.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an item).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCourseCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CodeSphereParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CodeSphereParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes throw a ParseException if there are any errors with the arguments.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the app data i.e., all `Course` and `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCourseList` and `UniqueStudentList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Course` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Course>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected course's' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)
![Interactions Inside the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save both CourseList data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* can save user inputs and retrieve them in the future
* inherits from both `CourseListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

The Storage component builds upon the AB-3 Storage component by adding an InputStorage, which encapsulates the concept of
storing user inputs.
These user inputs are stored in chronological order and are accessed through the StorageManager.
All user inputs will be stored in the InputStorage, and will also contain the data whether the input was accepted as a
valid command or not. Handling of this input validity will be done by the UI component. 


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.codesphere.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add a student
After selecting a `Course` from the `UniqueCourseList`,  `Student` objects can be added into the `UniqueStudentList` of the `Course`.  Compulsory fields for the `AddCommand` include `Name`, `Email` and a performance `Tag`. The optional `Remark` and `PendingQuestion` fields cannot be added using the `AddCommand`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the adding mechanism works. We will skip to where the `AddCommand#execute()` method is called.

* Step 1. The `AddCommand` object’s `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. `StageManager` is used to obtain the current `Course` selected.
* Step 3. A check for duplicates in the `UniqueStudentList` of the current `Course` is done. If the new `Student` to be added already exists, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 4. The new `Student` is added into the `UniqueStudentList` of the current `Course`.


### Edit a student
`Student` objects are stored in their respective Course’s `UniqueStudentList`. The details (name, email, remark, pending question, tag) of a student in a course can be edited by changing the fields of the `Student` object.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the editing mechanism is carried out on a `Student` in a course. We will skip to where the `EditCommand#execute()` method is called.

* Step 1. The `EditCommand` object’s `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. The index provided is checked to be within bounds of the course’s student list. If it is not, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 3. A new `Student` object, `editedStudent` is created with the edited inputs.
* Step 4. A check for duplicates in the current course is done. If there is a duplicate, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 5. The original student in the current course’s student list is replaced with `editedStudent`.

### Edit a course
A course’s course name can be edited by changing the `CourseName` field of a `Course` object.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the editing mechanism is carried out. As per the examples above, we will skip to where the `EditCourseCommand#execute()` method is called.

* Step 1. The `EditCourseCommand` object’s `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. The index provided is checked to be within bounds of the course’s student list. If it is not, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 3. A new `Course` object, `editedCourse` is created with the edited course name.
* Step 4. A check for duplicates in the model is done. If there is a duplicate, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 5. The original course is replaced with `editedCourse`.

### Add a Pending Question to a Student from a selected Course

#### About the adding a pending question feature

The `pq` command allows the user to add a pending question to a student based on the index input from the user.
For example, a user could add a pending question such as `Tutorial 1 Question 10` to the second student from the list by using `pq 2 pq/Tutorial 1 Question 10`.
It's important to note that adding a pending question to a student is not cumulative. In other words, adding another pending question to a student with an existing pending question will replace the old pending question with the new one.

#### Implementation Details
The partial class diagram of the `pq` command can be seen.

#### Parsing user input
1. The user inputs the `pq` command, provides the index of the targeted student, and follows it by the pending question using the prefix `pq`.
2. The `CodeSphereParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `PendingQuestionCommandParser`.
3. The `PendingQuestionCommandParser` parses the user input and checks whether the input is the correct format. For example, the index must be valid and the input after `pq` cannot be empty.
<br>
If the conditions are not met, a `ParseException` is thrown.

#### Command execution
1. The `LogicManager` executes the `PendingQuestionCommand`.
2. `StageManager` is used to retrieve the current `Course` by calling `StageManager#getCurrentCourse()`.
3. The `PendingQuestionCommand` calls the `Course#getFilteredStudentList()` to obtain a list of `Student` belonging to the course object and identify the targeted `Student` from the list.
4. A check for index from the user input will be done.If the index is invalid, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
5. A new `Student` object is created by passing in the `PendingQuestion` instance to the Student constructor.
6. Update the newly created Student instance to replace the old Student instance.

#### Displaying of result
1. The `PendingQuestionCommand` will create a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the LogicManager to complete the command execution. The GUI will also be updated accordingly as it calls the `filteredStudentList` which was updated during the execution of the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `pq` mechanism works:

### Finding a student from a selected course

#### About the find feature

The `find` command allows users to search for relevant students based on details of the specified criteria in their input. For example, a user could use `find n/KEYWORDS` to find a students names which contain or match that with the keywords.
They can use keywords in `NAME`, `EMAIL`, `TAG`, `REMARK` to find students with words or phrases containing all of the words mentioned in keywords.
Do note that only 1 criteria can be used at one time.

#### Implementation Details

The partial class diagram of the `find` command can be seen. What is important to note here is the use of a `Predicate` class and the `updateFilteredStudentList` method which utilises the predicate class.

![FindCommandPartial](images/FindCommandClassDiagram.png)

Their are multiple different predicate classes created to accurately filter through the student list. Below, is the example usage scenario and how the `find` mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Parsing user input

1. The user inputs the `find` command and provide the input with the attribute of the student contact and its respective prefix (eg. `n/NAME` or `r/REMARK`) in which the user wants to find the student.

2. The `CodeSphereParser` then does preliminary processing to the user input and creates a new `FindCommandParser`.

3. The `FindCommandParser` parses the user inputs and checks for whether the input is the correct format. The input needs to contain only 1 prefix and the keywords cannot be empty.

If the conditions are not met a `ParseException` is thrown.

4. If the format is valid, a predicate class matching the prefix is created. For example, for `NAME`, the predicate object created is `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`. This class takes in the values of the keywords and the object is passed into the newly created `FindCommand` object.

#### Command execution

1. The `LogicManager` executes the `FindCommand`.

2. The `FindCommand` calls the `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the filtered person list based on predicate class.

3. The `FindCommand` then calls the `Model#getFilteredPersonList()#size()` to get the size of the person list. The size will correspond to the number of persons listed.

#### Displaying of result

1. The `FindCommand` will create a `CommandResult` with a success message and return it to the `LogicManager` to complete the command execution. The GUI will also be updated accordingly as it calls the `filteredStudentList` which was updated during the execution of the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find` mechanism works:

![](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How should multiple keywords be considered

- *Currently:* Whether all keywords are contained in any order in the specified criteria
- *Alternative 1:* At least 1 keyword is contained

**Pros and Cons:**
- *Currently:*
  - **Pros:** Provides a more specific and refined search.
  - **Cons:** May result in fewer matches if all keywords are not present.

- *Alternative 1:*
  - **Pros:** Increases the likelihood of finding matches.
  - **Cons:** Might lead to less precise results if only one keyword is present.

**Aspect:** How should the filtered list be filtered based on the keywords

- *Currently:* As long as keywords are contained inside
- *Alternative 1:* Instead of contains, do a complete word match

**Pros and Cons:**
- *Currently:*
  - **Pros:** More flexible and tolerant to variations in keyword placement.
  - **Cons:** May include irrelevant matches if keywords are part of larger words.

- *Alternative 1:*
  - **Pros:** Provides more precise matching by requiring complete word matches.
  - **Cons:** May exclude relevant matches if keywords are not complete words.

These considerations and alternatives should be weighed based on the specific requirements and expected user experience in your application.
