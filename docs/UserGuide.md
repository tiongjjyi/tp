## **Quick Start**

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `codesphere.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for the CodeSphere app.
4. Double-click the file to run the app. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. This is the home page. Note how the app contains some sample data.

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

In the command box, type in any command and hit enter to execute the command! 
Eg. typing `help` and hitting enter after will show the Help window. Some other example commands you can try:
* `help` : View help.
* `select 1` : Selects and goes into the 1st course in the course list.
* `add c/CS1101S` : Adds a course named `CS1101S` to the course list.
* `edit 1 c/CS1231S` : Updates the first course in the course list with the edited course name.
* `delete 3` : Deletes the third course shown in the course list.
* `exit` : Exits the app.

## **Features**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  * e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  * e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/GOOD` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  * e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/GOOD`, `t/GOOD t/AVERAGE` etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  * e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Saving the data

CodeSphere data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

CodeSphere data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/codesphere.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

## **FAQ**

Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?
A: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CodeSphere home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Known Issues**

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, 
the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the preferences.json file created by the application before running the application again.
