<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## **Quick Start**

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `codesphere.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for the CodeSphere app.
4. Double-click the file to run the app. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. This is the home page. Note how the app contains some sample data.

   ![Ui](images/HomePage.png)

In the command box, type in any command and hit enter to execute the command!
Eg. typing `help` and hitting enter after will show the Help window. Some other example commands you can try:
* `help` : View help.
* `select 1` :  Selects the first course and navigates to the list of students in this course.
* `add c/CS1101S` : Adds a course named `CS1101S` to the course list.
* `edit 1 c/CS1231S` : Updates the first course in the course list with the edited course name.
* `delete 3` :
    * If you are currently on the home page, it deletes the third course shown in the current list.
    * If you are currently on the course page, it deletes the third student shown in the current list.

* `exit` : Exits the app.

For a more detailed walk-through on how to use CodeSphere to start managing your students, head to [Tutorial for Beginners](#tutorial-for-beginners).
Else, if you prefer exploring the app yourself, head to [Features](#features) below for the list of commands.

## **Tutorial for Beginners**
*If you are not a beginner, or would like to explore CodeSphere on your own,
feel free to skip this tutorial or jump to whichever portion you require.*

### Tutorial Contents
1. [**Adding a course**](#tutorial-adding-a-course)
2. [**Adding students**](#tutorial-adding-students)
3. [**Adding remarks / pending questions**](#tutorial-adding-remarks--pending-questions)

**Let's explore CodeSphere's features through the eyes of a typical TA.**
As you enter into the application for the first time, after a brief splash screen of the CodeSphere logo,
you will see an empty page. This is our `home` page, used to display a list of all the courses that you wish to manage.

![Empty Homepage](images/tutorial/homepage_empty.png)

At the top of the application, there is an underlined portion that we will refer to as the *Command Line*.
This is where your commands are typed, and they are confirmed by pressing the ***ENTER*** key on your keyboard.
Below the Command Line is the *Result Box* (which is the outlined box),
which will tell you the outcome of any commands that you have entered.
Lastly, underneath that is the *Display Panel*, which will be updated after each command is entered.


### Tutorial: Adding a course

*(For demonstration purposes, we'll be using `CS1101S` as our chosen course.
Feel free to replace this with any course of your choosing.)*

Let's begin by adding our course into our home page with the command `add c/CS1101S`.
You should see the course immediately appear in the list,
and a result informing you that there is a *New course added: CS1101S*

![CS1101S in Homepage](images/tutorial/homepage_CS1101S.png)

### Tutorial: Adding students

Let us add some students into this course.
First, we will have to navigate into our CS1101S course by using the command
`select 1`, which selects the first item in the course list.
The course's item number is displayed beside the course name (note the **1.** beside *CS1101S* in the picture)

Your application should update to look like something like this.
The course entry (CS1101S) displays the summary statistics of all the students listed within the course (currently none).
*Tip: You can always refer to the Result Box to see whether the command you entered has been successful*

![Empty CS1101S](images/tutorial/course_CS1101S.png)

The course is currently empty, so let's add a few students into the list with the following commands:
*(Remember to press 'Enter' after each command)*
`add n/John Tan e/e0123456@u.nus.edu t/good`
`add n/Mary Lim e/e1234567@u.nus.edu t/average`
`add n/David Lee e/e2345678@u.nus.edu t/poor`

>:information_source: Note: When creating students, you must always include their name (`n/`), email (`e/`) and performance tag (`t/`).

![Filled CS1101S](images/tutorial/course_students.png)

### Tutorial: Adding remarks / pending questions

Lastly, we shall look into adding remarks or pending questions for the students.
Let's add a remark "Will be 15 minutes late for tutorial" to our student *John Tan* (who is number 1 in the list)
by typing
`remark 1 r/Will be 15 minutes late for tutorial`.

Likewise, let's note down Mary's pending question about "Tutorial 2 Question 4" through the command
`pq 2 pq/Tutorial 2 Question 4`.

Your page should now be updated with the remark and pending question under the respective student's data entry.

![Add Remark and PQ](images/tutorial/remark_pq.png)

And there you have it! Your first course created, with students' details and even extra information all noted down,
displayed to you at a glance!

>:bulb: As a final tip, you can use the directional ***UP*** and ***DOWN*** keys on your keyboard to access the commands that
you have previously entered.

Feel free to explore CodeSphere's other features, such as
[listing out all students with pending questions](#list-all-pending-questions-list),
[sorting the students by different criteria](#sorting-all-students-sort) or even
[finding students with certain keywords in selected field](#finding-a-student-find).

There's many features specially curated for you to manage your students with ease,
so have fun and may your administrative work be effortless!

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## **Features**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
    * e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    * e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/GOOD` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
    * e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/GOOD`, `t/GOOD t/AVERAGE` etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
    * e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### **Miscellaneous**

### Saving the data

CodeSphere data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

CodeSphere data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/codesphere.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

## **FAQ**

Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?
A: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CodeSphere home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Known Issues**

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen,
   the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the preferences.json file created by the application before running the application again.
